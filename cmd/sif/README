Images sent via the Digital Sending Network aren't encoded with any normal
encoding; instead, they're encoded in a special Space Image Format. None of
the Elves seem to remember why this is the case. They send you the
instructions to decode it.

Images are sent as a series of digits that each represent the color of a
single pixel. The digits fill each row of the image left-to-right, then move
downward to the next row, filling rows top-to-bottom until every pixel of the
image is filled.

Each image actually consists of a series of identically-sized layers that are
filled in this way. So, the first digit corresponds to the top-left pixel of
the first layer, the second digit corresponds to the pixel to the right of
that on the same layer, and so on until the last digit, which corresponds to
the bottom-right pixel of the last layer.

For example, given an image 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall, the image data
123456789012 corresponds to the following image layers:

Layer 1: 123
         456

Layer 2: 789
         012

The image you received is 25 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.
